  Execute build inside a <a href="http://www.docker.io">Docker container</a>. This allows full control on
  build environment by the development team, and full isolation between jobs and concurrent builds.
  <p>
  The SCM checkout will occur on the build slave as with a standard jenkins build,
  but all later build steps will execute within the container. The project workspace is mounted inside
  container as <code>/var/workspace</code> and build steps are executed from this directory.

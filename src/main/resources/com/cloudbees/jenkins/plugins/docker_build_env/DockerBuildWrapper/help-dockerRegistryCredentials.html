    If your Docker build node is configured to use a private registry in replacement for the default
    public DocherHub, or the Docker image you have configured for this build do point to a private registry
    "<code>docker.mycompany.com/my-bucket/ubuntu:secret-version</code>" - either as an image ID or parent
    <code>FROM</code> reference in Dockerfile - then specify the registry credentials here so docker client
    is configured accordingly and can pull from this registry.

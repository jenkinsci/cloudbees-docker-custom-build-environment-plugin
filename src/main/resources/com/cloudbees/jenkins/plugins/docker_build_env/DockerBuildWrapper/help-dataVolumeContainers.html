Mount volumes from Data Volume Container(s) into the Docker container.
<p>
If you have some persistent data that you want to share between containers, or
want to use from non-persistent containers, itâ€™s best to create a named Data
Volume Container, and then to mount the data from it.
<p>
An example of this is when Jenkins is running in a Docker container and needs to
share its workspace and '/tmp' dir with the docker-custom-build-environment
container. To accomplish this, create a Data Volume Container named
'jenkinsdata' which exposes volumes '/var/jenkins_home' and '/tmp'. Mount these
volumes in the 'jenkinsmaster' container via `--volumes-from jenkinsdata`. Once
'jenkinsmaster' is up and running, create a job that uses the
docker-custom-build-environment plugin and mount the same volumes by specifying
'jenkinsdata' in the Data Volume Container Name field.
<p>
**NOTE** In order for the above example to work, the "Jenkins dirs in Data Volume Container"
checkbox must also be checked.
